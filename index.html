<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I have lived in New York my entire life and have completed all of my
training here. I attended Columbia University for my undergraduate
degree, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell for medical
school, and Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine for internal medicine
residency. Currently, I am completing my GI fellowship at NYP –
Columbia, where I am the chief fellow. As I complete my fellowship, I am
also pursuing a master’s degree in patient-oriented research at the
Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. Throughout my training, I’ve
had a sustained interest in academic research, with a focus on celiac
disease and have many publications in this area.</p>

<p>This plot allows the viewer to zoom in and see granular data of
restaurant score per cuisine type per borough. The worst score occurred
in Manhattan at zip code 10065 and was of an Indian restaurant, with a
score of 83. Since there are scores less than 28 (which is needed to get
a grade of C), this suggests that there were restaurants that improved
in their score after re-inspection but did not yet have their grade
changed.</p>
